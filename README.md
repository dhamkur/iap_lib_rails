# In App Purchase - Ruby Code Base

I build this code base is due to their official documentation which find complex for IAP. You can copy this library to your services folder or lib folder in your Rails Application.

This IAP code base to verify your payment transaction from mobile apps to back-end as an API to save in the database.

- The version of the google-api-client is 0.53.0
- You can also use HTTParty to make a request transaction for Google IAP
- Available code base IAP verification for iOS/Android

## Notes

For google-api-client there is some difference columns on the result response. You can also use direct URL REST Endpoint from [Developers Google Documentation](https://developers.google.com/android-publisher/api-ref/rest/v3/purchases.subscriptions) to have full response.
